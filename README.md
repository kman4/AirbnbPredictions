## Background

Our goal here is to increase the transparency of the Airbnb pricing process by predicting the prices of listings in New York!

## Questions

1.	Is location the most important factor in determining listing prices?
2.	How much does the amenities and the size of the unit impact the listing prices?
3.	How does the number of units available within a specific area affect the price of Airbnb?
4.	Do good reviews drive up the rates?
5.	Should a host price their listing differently during a specific time of the week, month, year and holidays?
